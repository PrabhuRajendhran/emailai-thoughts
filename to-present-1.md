# Slide Mock-Up: LLM-Prompt vs Hybrid Intelligent Routing

---

**Slide Title:**
**Enterprise Email Routing: LLM-Prompt System vs Hybrid Platform**

---

**Visual Layout:**

* Two vertical columns, side by side:

  * **Left:** LLM-Prompt System (Current) → Light Blue
  * **Right:** Hybrid Intelligent Routing (Proposed) → Green
* Icons in front of each row:

  * ⚡ Latency / speed
  * 💰 Cost
  * 🏢 Enterprise-scale
  * 🛡️ Governance / compliance

| Dimension                      | LLM-Prompt System (Current)                                           | Hybrid Platform (Proposed)                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability Across Units**   | ⚠ One model serves all; multiple models possible but costly & complex | ✅ Modular; core engine + per-unit taxonomy & thresholds                 |
| **Cost Efficiency**            | ⚠ Expensive at high volume                                            | ✅ GPU-backed embeddings & re-rankers; low per-email cost                |
| **Latency**                    | ⚠ Variable; spikes under load                                         | ✅ Predictable <1s compute; 3–5s SLA met                                 |
| **Governance & Audit**         | ⚠ Limited; LLM rationales inconsistent & hard to track                | ✅ Full audit trail; Top-K candidates, confidence scores, human-in-loop  |
| **Taxonomy Handling**          | ⚠ Messy categories confuse LLM                                        | ✅ Externalized taxonomy; easy updates, no retrain required              |
| **Unit-Level Adaptation**      | ⚠ Difficult; multiple models per unit possible but costly             | ✅ Fine-tuning optional; thresholds & taxonomy allow per-unit adaptation |
| **Compliance Fit**             | ⚠ Explanations may not satisfy regulators                             | ✅ Confidence-based routing + escalation ensures controlled automation   |
| **Long-Term Enterprise Value** | ⚠ Point solution; not reusable enterprise-wide                        | ✅ Foundational infrastructure for document & workflow automation        |

**Visual Enhancements Suggestions:**

* Add checkmarks ✅ for Hybrid advantages, warning ⚠ for LLM limitations.
* Use subtle pipeline diagram under Hybrid column to show: Rules → Embeddings → Re-rank → Confidence → Routing.
* Highlight top 3 “MD concerns” in bold: Cost, SLA/Latency, Compliance.

# Suggested Talking Points

**Opening:**
“Currently, some units rely on LLMs with prompts to match messy taxonomies. This works well for small teams but does not scale to enterprise volumes of 1M emails per day, and it has significant cost, latency, and governance limitations.”

**Key Points:**

1️⃣ **Scalability:** “Hybrid platform is modular. Units can adjust thresholds and taxonomy independently — no need for multiple costly models.”

2️⃣ **Cost & Latency:** “LLM inference at scale is expensive and unpredictable. Our system uses GPU-backed embeddings and re-rankers, giving predictable 3–5s SLA at much lower cost.”

3️⃣ **Governance & Compliance:** “LLM rationales are generative and inconsistent. Hybrid platform provides Top-K candidates, confidence scores, and human-in-loop escalation — fully auditable and regulator-friendly.”

4️⃣ **Taxonomy & Adaptation:** “Hybrid platform separates taxonomy from model weights, so updates do not require full retraining, and per-unit customization is straightforward.”

5️⃣ **Enterprise Value:** “LLM-only solutions are team-scale. Hybrid platform creates reusable infrastructure for enterprise-wide email, document, and workflow automation.”

**Closing:**
“This approach protects operational efficiency, compliance reputation, and positions the enterprise for scalable AI infrastructure — it’s not just email routing, it’s the foundation for future intelligent automation.”

If you want, I can **turn this into an actual ready-to-use slide layout in PowerPoint / Google Slides style** — with icons, color coding, and a professional boardroom look — so you can drop it directly into your deck with **MD-level impact**.

Do you want me to do that next?
